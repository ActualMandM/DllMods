; Scales bloom correctly at all resolutions.
FixBloomScale=true

; Scales depth of field correctly at all resolutions.
FixDOFScale=true

; Forces final light color adjustment to get ignored like Sonic Unleashed.
ForceIgnoreFinalLightColorAdjustment=false

; Applies post processing to particles, just like Sonic Unleashed.
;
; Please note that custom stages and vanilla stages were not optimized for this,
; so some particles might look awfully bright or broken in a few stages. (eg. Aquarium Park)
PostProcessingOnParticles=true

[Shadows]
; Controls how much shadows blend while they are on top of each other.
; The lower the value, the higher the blending is.
;
; For example, Sonic Unleashed has these values set to 0
; which makes shadows blend with each other completely.
;
; Sonic Generations usually has them set to 0.3 which makes
; shadows blend less, thus appear darker.
;
; Set to -1 to have the stage set the values.
AmbientShadowBiasObject=-1
AmbientShadowBiasTerrain=-1

; Makes terrain cast real-time shadows.
; It looks like a mess in most stages and
; should be enabled only for entertainment purposes.
EnableTerrainShadowCast=false

; Forces all objects to cast shadows.
ForceCastShadow=false

; Forces all stages to use directional shadows.
ForceDirectionalShadow=true

; Controls the falloff-like effect on directional shadows.
; 
; Sonic Generations has this effect on for vertical shadows
; meanwhile Sonic Unleashed makes no use of it.

; 0 - Enable (controlled by stage)
; 1 - Force disable

[InternalResolution]
; If you enable this option, you can increase or decrease the
; game's internal rendering resolution. 
; In other words, this allows for both supersampling and downsampling
; without affecting the game's HUD.
;
; Increasing resolution will require more powerful hardware
; while decreasing the resolution will allow lower-end hardware
; to run the game more easily.
Scale=false

; Example resolutions:
;
; 720p: 1280x720
; 1080p: 1920x1080
; 2k: 2560x1440
; 4k: 3840x2160
;
; For supersampling, it's recommended that you do 2x your base resolution:
; 1280x720 x 2 = 2560x1440 while 1920x1080 x 2 = 3840x2160

Width=3840
Height=2160
